# pharanology
In todayâ€™s age paper exams are redundant as they are often very problematic; They could be leaked, cheating is trivial and human error is always there.

Pharanology is an engaging platform for taking exams that eliminates these issues and more, in addition to making the exam-taking experience more interactive & modern.

## How to test or contribute
1. Open Visual Studio Code and click on "Clone Git Repository..." in the start up page.
2. In the prompt, copy and paste `https://github.com/Voltonik/pharanology`
3. Open a terminal in vscode and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Now you can run the server and test by running `python manage.py runserver` and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/
5. If you want to access the django admin panel, you can create a superuser by running `python manage.py createsuperuser` and entering your username, email and password.

6. Create a new branch (by clicking on the icon at the very bottom left of vscode)
7. Make your changes (adding features, fixing issues, etc..)
8. Commit to the branch (by clicking on commit changes in the third tab in the left panel of vscode)
9. Then anyone can review the changes made by you and merge them to the "main" branch
