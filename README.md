# pharanology
In todayâ€™s age paper exams are redundant as they are often very problematic; They could be leaked, cheating is trivial and human error is always there.

Pharanology is an engaging platform for taking exams that eliminates these issues and more, in addition to making the exam-taking experience more interactive & modern.
